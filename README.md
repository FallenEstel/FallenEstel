(Stolen from @Just5MoreMinutes, dont worry were friends... i think) Currently im learning js, html, css and C#. All becaue of a single project more on that when i feel like i want to start posting about it. If you want to collaborate with me hit me up on twitter or discord, help is always appreciated!
